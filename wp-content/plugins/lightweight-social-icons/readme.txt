== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a widget with my icons? =

* Make sure Lightweight Social Icons is activated.
* Navigate to "Appearance > Widgets" and look for the "Lightweight Social Icons" widget.
* Drag the widget into your desired widget area.

Once the widget is added to a widget area, you can expand it and fill in your profiles.

= What options does Lightweight Social Icons have? =

* Choose your own order
* Title (optional): Choose a title for your widget.
* Icon size: Choose the size of the icon font.
* Border radius: Choose the border radius of the icon. Border radius refers to the "roundness" of the button.
* Background color: The background color of the button.
* Text Color: The icon color.

= How do I add my social profile URLs? =

In the select box on the left, choose your desired social media site.

To the right of the select box, enter in the URL of your profile on that specific social media site.

The "Skype" option takes your Skype username.

The "Phone" option takes your phone number.

= Can I assign different colors to each icon? =

Not at this time (without custom CSS of course). We're hoping to add this feature soon.

= Can I display my icons with a shortcode? =

Not by default, but you can use a plugin like this: https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-shortcode/

It allows you to add the widget to an arbitrary widget area, and then you can call that widget using a shortcode elsewhere in your website.
